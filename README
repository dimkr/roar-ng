# Overview #
############

roar-ng is a generic GNU/Linux distribution building system.

It provides an architecture-independent, flexible and portable infrastructure 
for the creation of fast and portable "live" GNU/Linux distributions. It 
provides support for the binary package format and repositories of various 
GNU/Linux distributions.

The development of roar-ng started as a collection of source hacks of Woof (the 
Puppy Linux build system) and evolved into a complete, independent 
re-implementation. It provides advanced features not found in Woof, such as 
parallel downloads, automatic package splitting, simple branding and easy 
porting to different processor architectures.

# Supported Architectures and Distributions #
#############################################

At the time of writing, roar-ng supports the x86 family (both x86 and x86_64) of
processor architectures, with ARM support under heavy development. More 
specifically, roar-ng is currently being adapted to for use with the Raspberry
Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Packages originating in the following distributions are supported:
 - Slackware
 - Debian GNU/Linux
 - Arch Linux
 - Ubuntu
 - Subito GNU/Linux (e.g packages built through roar-ng itself)

# Usage #
#########

Using roar-ng is pretty straight-forward: edit the configuration (under "conf") 
and run the scripts whose name begins with a digit.

The configuration consists of three files: bootrc, distrorc and package_list.
They contain various boot parameters, the distribution details (e.g its name,
version, etc') and the packages included in it, respectively.

Once the configuration is ready, roar-ng's can be executed. It consists of four
independent scripts:
 - 0setup, which downloads package lists from repositories and converts them to
   a common, simple format.
 - 1download, which downloads all packages included in the distribution.
 - 2createpackages, which extracts, optimizes and processes the packages.
 - 3builddistro, which builds a bootable media image. It accepts one parameter:
   the media type. Each media has a script under the "media" directory, which
   builds an image.
 - 4buildpackage, an optional script which builds a binary package from source,
   using chroot and 3builddistro's result. It accepts the package name as a
   parameter.

Always use a recent snapshot of roar-ng. Since its development model is based on 
incremental improvements, rather than "stable" releases, always obtain a fresh 
copy of the "master" branch before using it.
