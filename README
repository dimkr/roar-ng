# Overview #
############

roar-ng is a generic GNU/Linux distribution building system.

It provides an architecture-independent, flexible and portable infrastructure 
for the creation of fast and portable "live" GNU/Linux distributions. It 
provides support for the binary package format and repositories of various 
GNU/Linux distributions.

The development of roar-ng started as a collection of source hacks of Woof (the 
Puppy Linux build system) and evolved into a complete, independent 
re-implementation. It provides advanced features not found in Woof, such as 
parallel downloads, automatic package splitting, simple branding and easy 
porting to different processor architectures.

# Supported Architectures and Distributions #
#############################################

At the time of writing, roar-ng supports the x86 family (both x86 and x86_64) of
processor architectures, with ARM support under heavy development. More 
specifically, roar-ng is currently being adapted to for use with the Raspberry
Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Packages originating in the following distributions are supported:
 - Slackware
 - Debian GNU/Linux
 - Arch Linux
 - Ubuntu
 - Subito GNU/Linux (e.g packages built through roar-ng itself)

# Usage #
#########

Using roar-ng is pretty straight-forward: edit the configuration (under "conf") 
and run the scripts whose name begins with a digit.

Always use a recent snapshot of roar-ng. Since its development model is based on 
incremental improvements, rather than "stable" releases, always obtain a fresh 
copy of the "master" branch before using it.
