# Overview #
############

roar-ng is a generic GNU/Linux distribution building system.

It provides an architecture-independent, flexible and portable infrastructure 
for the creation of fast and portable "live" GNU/Linux distributions. It 
provides support for the binary package format and repositories of various 
GNU/Linux distributions.

The development of roar-ng started as a collection of source hacks of Woof (the 
Puppy Linux build system) and evolved into a complete, independent 
re-implementation. It provides advanced features not found in Woof, such as 
parallel downloads, automatic package splitting, simple branding and easy 
porting to different processor architectures.

#############################################
# Supported Architectures and Distributions #
#############################################

Packages originating in the following distributions are supported:
 - Slackware
 - Debian GNU/Linux
 - Arch Linux
 - Ubuntu
 - CentOS
 - Fedora
 - Raspbian
 - Subito GNU/Linux (e.g packages built through roar-ng itself)

Distribution support is provided by sub-directories under the "distro"
directory.

# Usage #
#########

Before roar-ng can be executed to produce a distribution, it must be properly
configured. Its configuration resides under the "conf" directory and consists
of three files:
 - bootrc - various boot-related or system initialization parameters, such as 
            the console font.
 - distrorc - the distribution's details, such as its name, version and most
              importantly, its target processor architecture.
 - package_list - the list of packages included in the distribution's bootable
                  media. Entries in the file have a special syntax and consist
                  of four fields: the distribution the binary packages come
                  from, a meta-package name (e.g "utilities" for a text editor
                  and a calculator), the names of packages (i.e the exact names,
                  as the source distribution uses) to include and how to split
                  the result package.

Just in case it isn't clear enough: here's another explanation. roar-ng reads
a package list, which consists of entries which describe "meta-packages", which
are "big packages" that consist of multiple packages of a supported
distribution. For instance, it is possible to group a package (for example, 
Bash) with its dependencies (e.g readline) as one meta-package, like this:
	debian|bash_and_deps|bash,readline|exe,dev,doc,nls

The fourth field (e.g the package splitting rules) can be confusing. Its syntax
is consistent: each of the tokens ("exe", "dev", "doc" or "nls") can be suffixed
with the ">" operator, followed by another, to change the way the meta-package 
is split. When a package is processed by roar-ng, it gets split into four parts:
the main package, development files, documentation and language support files.
Thse tokens represent those parts: for example, "exe,dev,doc>dev,nls" will 
instruct roar-ng to place all documentation alongside the development files.

Once the configuration is ready, roar-ng can be executed. It consists of four
independent scripts:
 - 0setup, which downloads package lists from repositories and converts them to
   a common, simple format.
 - 1download, which downloads all packages included in the distribution.
 - 2createpackages, which extracts, optimizes, splits and processes the 
   packages.
 - 3builddistro, which builds a bootable media image. It accepts one parameter:
   the media type. Each media has a script under the "media" directory, which
   builds an image.
 - 4buildpackage, an optional script which builds a binary package from source,
   using chroot and 3builddistro's result. It accepts the package name as a
   parameter.

Always use a recent snapshot of roar-ng. Since its development model is based on 
incremental improvements, rather than "stable" releases, always obtain a fresh 
copy of the "master" branch before using it.

# Contributing #
################

If you wish to contribute to roar-ng's development, there are many things you
can do (in the following priority):
 - Fix bugs.
 - Locate and fix inefficiencies.
 - Add support for another bootable media (e.g a SD card image for your favorite
   SoC).
 - Add support for another distribution.
 - Add bits of documentation.

The easiest way to begin your development is obtaining your own copy of roar-ng,
so you have something to work on; do not work with manually-applied patches.
Clone the code repository or manually maintain a copy.

Before you send a request to merge your changes, please:
 - Make sure your code doesn't conflict with roar-ng's current state, due to
   changes between time you began your development and the present.
 - Make sure your code is easy to understand, simple as possible, efficient and
   matches roar-ng's coding style.
 - Document your code.
 - Make sure you have a full history of changes; always document changes. Pay
   attention to issues you solved and interface changes.
 - Make sure your code is as future-proof as possible.
 - Make sure your code doesn't have a hard dependency on a third-party
   component (e.g a parser). This is required to keep roar-ng independent.

The actual code should be accompanied by all this information. If everything 
seems good (which is a very subjective thing), it might be merged into roar-ng
and you will be credited. However, no guarantees are made.

Any code contributed to roar-ng should conform with its license. Code which
doesn't simply won't be merged.
